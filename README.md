# WinARMdvd
 automated dvd ripping using makemkvcon for Windows
 
 I had a hard time getting ARM to work on ubuntu and there were complexities that I thought shouldn't be needed.  Also it is a script specifically for Unix/Linux distros.  I wanted something for Windows since that is what I typically run at home (more because I like games than anything).  So this is a C++/Win32 application that automatically detects your DVD/CD drives on start up, will auto-launch makemkv when a disk is inserted and eject the disk when done...hence the autmation part.  I wrote the original code over one weekend centering specifically on DVD's so I could backup my own personal collection.  I would like to eventually expand it for music as well and enhance it to handle tv and multiple movies on one disk.
